          I can't do this anymore. I truly miss everything about you. I miss
          you breaking out into song i miss hearing you sing or move to the rhythm.
          I miss hearing your silly questions, your alluring laugh even tho you think
          you sound like a hyena i love it. I miss your funny sarcasm. I want to take you 
          on late night drives. you said i wouldn't know unless i talked to someone else 
          its not true i dont need to entertain another to know you the one. When i'm having
          a blast of a time you enter my mind thats how i know, i want to sleep on call with you
          not cause i need to but cause i want you the only one i want to. Truth is i have found myself 
          but i also know that i definitely cant say goodbye. Unfortunately i have to keep it short for this to work
          and if you doing better and happier now then thats all i want but this is me breaking no contact. Maybe 
          i'll get a reply and if not i'm so glad you doing better i'll always be your biggest supporter and leave the 
          door open for you. I TRULY LOVE YOU
